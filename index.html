    <h4>A brief history of digital currencies</h4>
    <p>
        Prior to Bitcoin E-gold came into existense to meet the need of a "private" elecontronic currency. As it was the first of it's time and made in 1996 the creators 
        were not totally prepared for what might come from it's usage. E-gold found itself being used a currency for activities the government wasn't so fond of. As the government knew who the creators of the currency were
        they were able to order the creators to shut the entire thing down.
        
        "Satoshi Nakamoto", a pseudonym, would not make this mistake. Satoshi dreamed of a decentralized currency. One where you did not have to acquire from some central agency/authority. 
        One that would allow it's users to maintain anonymity and keep prying eyes away from their purchasing habits.
        
        Initially Bitcoin was easy to acquire through mining it via computer. As time passed the difficulty of mining icnreasing, today it is near impossible to mine a siginificant amount without icredibly computing power, 
        Much like E-gold bitcoin was also used for some not very legal activities and the overwhelming majority of users were able to maintain their privacy through its use.
